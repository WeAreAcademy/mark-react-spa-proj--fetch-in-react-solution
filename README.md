We looked at `fetch`ing data from an API away from a browser environment, when we were running TS with `ts-node` (and, under the hood, running JS with `node`).

We'll now look at how `fetch` can be used to load external data from an API into React in a browser environment.

## Learning Outcomes

- Load data from an API into React with `fetch` and `setState`
- Use conditional rendering in React

## Demo: fetching a joke

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** You can run the React app which fetches a joke in

This repo has an example React app which loads data from a joke API when a button is clicked.

There's a short delay between the button being clicked and the joke being loaded - because it takes some time for the transportation of data:

- HTTP Request: front-end asks for a joke from `https://jokestemp.neillbogie.repl.co/jokes/general/random`
- HTTP Response: the joke API server responds with a random joke

The `handleGetJoke` function has been written in both `async`/`await` style and Promise `.then` style. (Check that both work by commenting and de-commenting.)

## Exercise 1: showing a single random dog picture

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** Your React app loads in a new picture of a random dog of a _fixed given breed_ every time the button is clicked

Now, let's change our joke fetching app to a dog picture fetching app.

We'll use [this API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/random).

Make the relevant changes to the React app so that you are `fetch`ing from this API (and rendering an image using the data received).

(It's up to you whether you use the `async`/`await` or `.then`!)

## Exercise 2: accumulating images

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** Your React app contains a growing collection of dog pictures, adding a new random one every time a button is clicked

Currently, we're fetching a new dog picture every time we click a button - and discarding the previous one.

Instead, let's start to build up a nice, growing collection of them instead.

It may be helpful here to look up previous demos for array state!
